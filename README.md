# AI_and_Omics_Research_Internship
This repository documents my participation in the AI and Biotechnology / Bioinformatics: AI and Omics Research Internship (2025).

The internship focuses on applying R programming, data analysis, and bioinformatics tools to real biological datasets, with a structured set of assignments and projects.


## ğŸ“‚ Repository Structure
``` AI_Omics_Internship_2025/
â”‚â”€â”€ Processed Data/  # Cleaned datasets after preprocessing
â”‚â”€â”€ Raw Data/        # Original datasets (e.g., DEGs_Data_1.csv, patient_info.csv)
â”‚â”€â”€ Scripts/         # R scripts for assignments and tasks
â”‚â”€â”€ Worspace/        # Saved R workspace from each session
â”‚â”€â”€ results/         # Processed outputs, results tables, and summaries
â”‚â”€â”€ plots/           # Figures and visualizations
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md        # Project documentation

## ğŸ“š Internship Modules
**Module I: Getting Started with R**
* Basics of R operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
* Understanding data structures: vectors, lists, matrices, data frames
* Writing user-defined functions in R
* Automating workflows using for-loops
* Handling missing values in datasets

## ğŸ“Œ Key Assignments:
**1. BMI Analysis**
* Function to calculate BMI
* Applied to multiple datasets using a for-loop
* Saved results into organised folders

**2. Differential Gene Expression (DGE) Analysis**
* Function classify_gene() to categorise genes as:
* Upregulated (log2FC > 1 & padj < 0.05)
* Downregulated (log2FC < -1 & padj < 0.05)
* Not Significant (otherwise)
* Applied classification across DGE datasets
* Exported processed results and printed summary counts

## ğŸ§ª Skills Refreshed (I had prior R experience)
* Setting up R projects and working directories
* Writing and applying functions in R
* Looping workflows for multiple datasets
* Data cleaning and handling NA values
* Exporting results systematically (CSV, RData)
* Organising research projects with reproducibility in mind
